First things first, ensure you have go binary installed on your machine.\n$ git clone https://github.com/onweru/compose/ cd compose/exampleSite/ hugo server To pull in theme updates, run hugo mod get -u ./... from the theme folder. If unsure, learn how to update hugo modules\nThe exampleSite uses the theme as a hugo module by default.\nIf you choose Option 2 or Option 3 below, ensure you edit these lines in the config.toml file as advised on the comments. Else, you will not be able to pull theme updates.\nOption 2 (recommended) Generate a new Hugo site and add this theme as a Git submodule inside your themes folder:\nhugo new site yourSiteName cd yourSiteName git init git submodule add https://github.com/onweru/compose/ themes/compose cp -a themes/compose/exampleSite/* . Then run\nhugo server Hurray!\nOption 3 (Great for testing quickly) You can run your site directly from the exampleSite. To do so, use the following commands:\ngit clone https://github.com/onweru/compose/ cd compose/exampleSite/ hugo server --themesDir ../.. Although, option 3 is great for quick testing, it is somewhat problematic when you want to update your theme. You would need to be careful not to overwrite your changes. Once set, jump over to the config.toml file and start configuring your site.\n","link":"https://uin-ipi.github.io/docs/compose/install-theme/","section":"docs","title":"Install theme"},{"body":"Do you prefer managing your site using a CMS? Or would you like to make it easier for someone (a non-techie, perhaps) in your team to make edits easily? If interested, follow along. Else, skip to the next section\nLet\u0026rsquo;s sync your site with forestry CMS.\nPrerequisites !! Obviously you ought to have a github account. This is where your website source will live. Basically, forestry will read from github and write (commmit) to your github repo.\nGitlab or bitbucket will work too. Just check their implementation here. Happy fishing. Requirement 1 : A Forestry account Jump over to forestry and sign up for an account. Consider signing up using your github account. That way, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to deal with passwords.\nRequirement 2: A Netlify account (optional) If you intend to host with something other than Netlify e.g github pages, please scroll on. Hosting with Netlify is a lot of fun though; I highly recommend it.\nStep 1 : Fork or Clone Compse theme First we will fork this theme\u0026rsquo;s template.\nStep 2 : Add your repository in Forestry The exampleSite already comes with prefilled default forestry settings. If you set up your site using option 2, look for a file .forestry/settings.yml and remove all exampleSite/ strings from it. Go to your forestry account and click on import your site now.\nChoose hugo github or gitlab. wherever your repo is at.

Unlike other regular pages, the documentation pages will have a left sidebar. This sidebar will list links to all the pages in the documentation pages. Beneath each link, there will be a collapsible list of table of contents\u0026rsquo; links. These nested lists will unfold automatically on the active/current page.\nHome Page At the root level there\u0026rsquo;s an _index.md page which is the homepage. Feel free to edit it as you like.\nOther pages You can also add as many regular pages as you like e.g about.md, contact.md\u0026hellip;\nTake advantage of shortcodes to customize the layouts of these pages and any other.\nDoes this theme support blogging function? Currently, no.\n","link":"https://uin-ipi.github.io/docs/compose/organize-content/","section":"docs","title":"Content organization"},{"body":"Instead of writing all your site pages from scratch, Hugo lets you define and use shortcodes.\nWhy shortcodes? While markdown is sufficient to produce simple pages, it\u0026rsquo;s insufficient where complex page structures are needed. Thusly, whenever we need special styling, shortcodes compliment the shortcomings of markdown.\nThis way, you can side step complex html and css boilerplate in your content files.\nSometimes, the shortcode will wrap content, sometimes it won\u0026rsquo;t. When content is wrapped, a closing shortcode tag is needed. Please see the link I provided above and the markdown files for examples. You\u0026rsquo;ll get the gist pretty quickly.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve setup the following shortcodes:\nBlock Takes positional modifiers\nExample\n... {{\u0026lt; block \u0026#34;modifiers\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} \u0026lt;!-- Nest columns or content --\u0026gt; {{\u0026lt; /block \u0026gt;}} ...

By default Fuse is applied. Algolia can be enabled by adding this settings to config/_default/params.toml file\n# search [search] on = true global = false [search.algolia] enable = false # if false search will default to fusejs id = \u0026#34;Q40WQQX84U\u0026#34; # Application ID index = \u0026#34;compose\u0026#34; # Index name key = \u0026#34;da87401a458102ec6bbd6cc5e5cf8d95\u0026#34; # Search-Only API Key Both search engines will display results using the same UI. By choosing the default (.ie fuse js), you will be opting for local search. This way, no additional setup is needed.\nAlgolia will require you to build and host your index. For those using Github, this theme ships with an algolia github action.\nBy default, search will return results from the current content section. Searches from the top level section e.g the homepage, will return global results. This way, the results are scoped. You can override this behaviour using this setting\n... [search] ... global = false # turn to `true` to enable global search ... At the time of this writing, search on these theme takes either of this forms:\n1. Passive search This occurs only when the user loads the search page i.e /search/. They can directly navigate to that url. Alternatively, the user can type you search query on the search field and click enter. They will be redirected to the search page which will contain matched results if any.\n2. Live search This behaviour will be obvious as the user types a search query on the search field. All valid search queries, will yield a list of quick links or a simple no matches found. Else, the user will be prompted to continue typing.\nPlease note that the results under quick links will be a truncated list of the most relevant results. Only a maximum of 8 items will be returned. This number is pragmatic at best if not arbitrary. On the search page, the number is set to 12.\nNote that live search on the search page will behave differently than on the other pages. Nonetheles, the pages apply the same live search principle.\nHitting enter while typing on the search page will be moot as that page’s content will live update as you type in the search word / phrase.\nCustomize search feedback labels Use the i18n files to do so.\nWhat is a valid search query A valid search query must be long enough. If the search query can be cast as a float, then it only need contain one or more characters.\nElse the search query must be at least 2 characters long.\n","link":"https://uin-ipi.github.io/docs/compose/search/","section":"docs","title":"Search Function"},{"body":"Mermaid is library that helps you generate diagrams, flowcharts, and piecharts from text in a similar manner as markdown.\nWith compose theme, you can use mermaid using a custom shortcode as follows:\nSequence Diagrams Snippet\n{{\u0026lt; mermaid \u0026gt;}} sequenceDiagram participant Alice participant Bob Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;prevail...

Under params add enableDarkMode = false to your config.toml file. If your site is based on the exampleSite, the value is already included; you only need to uncomment it.\nThe user will still have the option to activate dark mode, if they so wish through the UI\nHow do I change the theme color? If the theme is a git submodule, you can copy the file assets/sass/_variables.sass from the theme into your own site. The location must be exactly the same as in the theme, so put it in YourFancySite/assets/sass/. You can then edit the file to customize the theme color in your site without having to modify the theme itself.\nHow can I change the address bar color on mobile devices?

See installation steps from Hugo\u0026rsquo;s official docs.\nGetting up and running Read the prerequisites above and verify you\u0026rsquo;re using the extended version of Hugo. There are at least two ways of quickly getting started with Hugo and the VMware Clarity theme:\nOption 1 (recommended) Generate a new Hugo site and add this theme as a Git submodule inside your themes folder:\nhugo new site yourSiteName cd yourSiteName git init git submodule add https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity themes/hugo-clarity cp -a themes/hugo-clarity/exampleSite/* . Then run\nhugo server Hurray!\nOption 2 (Great for testing quickly) You can run your site directly from the exampleSite. To do so, use the following commands:\ngit clone https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity cd hugo-clarity/exampleSite/ hugo server --themesDir ../.. Although, option 2 is great for quick testing, it is somewhat problematic when you want to update your theme. You would need to be careful not to overwrite your changes.\nOption 3 (The new, most fun \u0026amp; painless approach) This option enables you to load this theme as a hugo module. It arguably requires the least effort to run and maintain in your website.\nFirst things first, ensure you have go binary installed on your machine.\ngit clone https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity.git clarity cd clarity/exampleSite/ hugo mod init my-site Open config.toml file in your code editor, replace theme = \u0026quot;hugo-clarity\u0026quot; with theme = [\u0026quot;github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity\u0026quot;] or just theme = \u0026quot;github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity\u0026quot;.\nHurray you can now run\nhugo server To pull in theme updates, run hugo mod get -u ./... from the theme folder.

I.e., if the underlying OS is set to dark mode, the site will automatically load in dark mode. Regardless of the default mode, a UI control switch exists to override the theme mode at the user\u0026rsquo;s discretion.\nIn order to override this behavior and force one mode or another, add either enforceLightMode or enforceDarkMode to your config.toml file. If neither value is present, add it.\nTo enforce Light Mode by default, turn enforceLightMode to true.\nTo enforce Dark Mode by default, turn enforceDarkMode to true\n[params] ... enforceLightMode = true # Force the site to always load in light mode. ... Please note that you cannot enforce both modes at the same time. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, would it?\nPlease also note that the mode toggle UI will remain in place. That way, if a user prefers dark mode, they can have their way. The best of both worlds.\nI18N This theme supports Multilingual (i18n / internationalization / translations)\nThe exampleSite gives you some examples already. You may extend the multilingual functionality by following the official documentation.\nThings to consider in multilingual:\nsupported languages are configured in config/_default/languages.toml add new language support by creating a new file inside i18n directory. Check for missing translations using hugo server --i18n-warnings taxonomy names (tags, categories, etc\u0026hellip;) are translated in i18n as well (translate the key) menus are translated manually in the config files config/_default/menus/menu.xx.toml menu\u0026rsquo;s languages list are semi-hardcoded. You may chose another text for the menu entry with languageMenuName. Please, do better and create a PR for that. content must be translated individually. Read the official documentation for information on how to do it. note: if you do NOT want any translations (thus removing the translations menu entry), then you must not have any translations.
